								<h2>Personal information</h2>
								<p>Hello! My name is Chansouda Chaleunsouk, or you can call me Bibo as it could be easier for you. I am an international student currently doing bachelor of IB (international Business). I am from Laos which is from south east Asia. I can speak Lao, Thai and English. I like to play games, watch movies and anime, and I used to cosplay in Australia while I was staying in Australia.</p>

								<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
								<p>My interest in IT would be when I have my first social media platform (Facebook) that I can reach friends, post messages and get attention by post from others. My personal thought in IT last 7 years ago was “wow! IT is cool! I wonder what else IT could do more?” Then I have seen IT start developing by appearing in everyone’s life by social media platforms, businesses world, entertainments, communications and convenience to everyone’s life circle. When I was coming to Australia for the first time, it was very interesting for me that I have seen even more Technologies are everywhere. Moreover, when I attend RMIT for the first time, to access RMIT WIFI which is free access, but the system require my username and password which I figure out my username is my student number and password is my DOB that is surprise me that IT is smart and able to knows about personal information and IT is a part of my studies since when I start in RMIT.</p>
                                <p>I have chosen to study in RMIT because I got recommended from my cousin and my older sister graduated from RMIT in 2016 as an accountant. In addition, RMIT stands for ”Royal Melbourne institute Technology” according to RMIT website, RMIT offers many classes, one of the classes are Technologies, Information Technology. I do believe that RMIT is all in one that I am confident to choose to study with because not only quality, but also communities which make students and teachers 'life convenient, stay connected and up to date to technologies that help and let everyone learn rapidly.</p>
								<p>As this semester will be my final semester, I am expecting that I will be able to learn basic IT and other courses as much as I can. However, It is a disadvantage that I am not in Australia which is challenging me because the different time zones will not be able to meet up with other people and studying online and hard to form a group as it is difficult to trust from another classmate. But I do trust that I will gain experiences from last semester as much as I can. Even all subjects that I have chosen are elective. Nevertheless, Introduction to Information technology is an important course that will let me understand deeply more about technologies, be a part of a skill that I need to help me to develop in my future career, assist me in business and my daily life circle.</p>

								<h2>Ideal job</h2>
							    <p>My ideal job would be working with a company with well-know business in the marketplace. Also related to IT itself. So what i found in the website seek.com.au which is IT Business Analyst from Licensing Essentials Pty Ltd. As it is an Australia's industry leader in licensed merchandise and operator of The AFL Stores Group consists of a wholesale, retail, and industrial operation, they are looking for an IT Business Support Analyst to help us with our next phase of expansion. Which is interesting to me because it is about business. As the job itself requires an experienced IT Business Support Analyst to provide administrative support and maintenance for the company, which sounds interesting and challenging for me to learn and earn from their company. I do believe that I have coordinated tasks and project activities, E-commerce, facilitation skills, attention to detail, analytical and problem-solving skills, interpersonal and consultative skills. As I may have limited some of the skills that companies require, I am expecting that I will get more lessons and experiences from RMIT for better understanding of Administration of Business/IT systems, technical and business stakeholders in stakeholders.</p>

								<h2>Myers-Briggs test (16personalities)</h2>
								<p>As the result of those tests that I provide above, there are discover my personal itself and surprise me. Since I have not known myself well and it also showed what skill, personal and mindset hidden in myself. While I have done the tests, it was reminding me to think about myself very deeply, who I am and what is hidden inside my thoughts. 
									The tests result show how my personal and my behaviour when I must work in a team. It would help me to realize and be aware when I will work with new members and I will know how I will be comfortable while working with a team. When I know that my behaviour will influence in a team, I will talk to others to let them know so there will give times for myself and the team to understand how it will enable to be better and benefit the teams can turn into fellow advocates.
									I will try to give context as much as possible. Information from the test can help immediately better understand my personality. Make it clear there is no “correct” personality type for forming a group. no one should feel like the test results will impact to form a group work. I will show my personality test and then review the results with others, it will help to learn more about others and the best ways to interact with another. Sharing and discussing the results helps everyone understand their own personalities and. Even if someone disagrees with the outcome, it’s an opportunity to share the test with new people and let others see how your personal accuracy is.</p>

						<h2>Project Idea (IT Project Idea)</h2>
						<div class="features">
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p>The project that I have been thinking about is a smart application called “ComCon” which stands for “Community Connect” that provides everyone to choose what they are interested in and bring people around the world who have the same interest to meet and keep in touch with each other. The application will provide a variety of platforms to let everyone use in all in one application. It will be available on iOS, Android and desktop devices. The application will target everyone especially teenagers, adults, and who are social butterflies. ComCon will not only let you meet new people, but for entertainment, can be socialized, can be just chit chat or can be professional discussion.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-gem"></span>
								<h3>Motivation</h3>
								<p>The application would be similar to other applications such as Facebook, Discord, Clubhouse etc. but ComCon will be simple and easier for everyone to register. I have been using Discord, Clubhouse, Facebook and others. However, I have to keep minimizing the app while I need to check the others. So what if i can make an application just all in one itself. I have an idea about ComCon that provides everything that you need in the app. So ConCom is not just the app where you can just post, chat or watch steam on the app, it can bring people that have the same interest to you by interacting with the post, room or watch steam.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
								<h3>Description</h3>
								<p>ComCon will be the application that will provide all in one app to the user by providing a blog, post, video, tutorial, live stream, room for chat, room for call, room for video and room for entertainment. As this project will be a huge planform but will keep the application simple and connivence for everyone to access. However, even the application will be easy to use but the application will have high security to make sure that everyone's personal details are safe and reliable. ComCon will target teenagers, adults, influencers or anyone that is really into socializing, and wanna meet new people around the world by just interacting with  just interacting with the content that they are sharing...</p>
								<ul class="actions">
									<li><a href="generic.html" class="button">Learn more</a></li>
								</ul>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
								<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
								<p>ConCom will provide a lot of convenience for users that can let them show off their content, so software, hardware that need in the application will be Social network design to make the platform simple but unique. Content management system (Admin, user, report) to check safe and reliable communities for everyone when using the application. Content creation (Post, blog, video), Communication platform (Chat, call, video) Entertainment (Live, Stream, etc) but the most important thing will be an advanced and simple unique feature to provide users joyable, impressive and convenient.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
								<h3>Skills Required</h3>
								<p>The skills required for the project would be program developer, website creator, program designer, communication, programming language, problem solving, critical thinking, Analytical skills, computer science, Data structures and algorithms, Document building process for maintenance and upgrades, Git, GitHub, Graphical user interface design (UI), Networking and more. 
 
									The challenging part will be as those are lots of skills required, since the application will be provided in mobile and desktop devices, there will require a lot of skills to assist, develop and deeply understand information technologies. The project will require a teammate to organise to bring it come to life.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
								<h3>Outcome</h3>
								<p>If the project of creating this application is successful, the outcome will be that everyone across the world will be able to communicate with each other using only this app. Everyone will be able to create their own preference, list what they are interested in, follow what they want to be or what they want to make. The application will be another platform to help people reach out more what they want to do and they want to be just only one app. The issue would be that once the app is for everyone to use, there will be bugs in the application system, hack or even security error when first released.</p>
