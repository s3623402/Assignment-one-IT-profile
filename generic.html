							<Blockquote>ComCon will be the application that will provide all in one app to the user by providing a blog, post, video, tutorial, live stream, room for chat, room for call, room for video and room for entertainment. As this project will be a huge planform but will keep the application simple and connivence for everyone to access. However, even the application will be easy to use but the application will have high security to make sure that everyone's personal details are safe and reliable. ComCon will target teenagers, adults, influencers or anyone that is really into socializing, and wanna meet new people around the world by just interacting with the content that they are sharing.</Blockquote>
							<Blockquote>Once user success in registering the app, the application will take a few steps to confirm user identity. The application needs the user to confirm the identity via confirm term and agreement on the app, email address and phone number to make the account on the application successful. Users have to give all information, otherwise, users will not be able to use the application. When users finish authentication. Everyone can make new content via post, make a blog, create video, start to make a room for the discussion with others, live or steam the game. ConCom has multiple features that will let users have a great time while using ConCom. ConCom is not just an application that allows you to chill and meet new people around the world, but ConCom can be used for professionals, study and connect to the business circle. As ConCom can provide the chat room to let professionals discuss the business, or can be an argument about the topic, or can be the app that brings people who do not know each other to share their similarity interests. ConCom will assist everyone across the world to stay connected by chatting in a room, interacting from posts or blogs that they like. SInce COVID-19 impacts everyone in the world, some areas are still in lockdown, that is another great opportunity to start being creative, learn, open the world to the network and explore other interests. ConCom achievement is to let everyone be themselves by showing what they choose what they want to be. Some people will not be good at showing their lifestyle but they are very good at speaking, or writing. Some people like to create content by revealing their life routine but they might not be great at writing. Some people just want to find a space that can share their interest, or exchange with people with the same interests. So that's why ConCom is a part of my IT project idea that wants to let everyone be themselves, showing and sharing their content, speak out and shine. Another goal for ConCom will be an application that helps people to meet and stay connected wherever people are. In addition, ConCom achievement will be a top-tier application that everyone can chill, learn, meet and speak out what people that they want to be and what they want to do.</Blockquote>
